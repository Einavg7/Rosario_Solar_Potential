## QGIS calculations

To prepare the layers for analysis the tools provided in QGIS open source software were used.  
The project file ```rosario.qgz``` includes all the layers and outputs for implementing the steps that are presented in the guide -
[**Technical Guide for Estimating Rooftop Solar Potential in a City**](https://www.bookdown.org/einavg7/sp_technical_guide/). 
This guide has another repository that can be found [here]().
