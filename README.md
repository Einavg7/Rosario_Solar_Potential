# Rosario, Argentina Solar Potential Map

This is a repository for a web map displaying solar potential for building rooftops in the city Rosario, Argentina.  
The building polygon layer was collected from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/-32.9671/-60.6759) using [GEOFABRIK](https://www.geofabrik.de/) and the solar potential was calculated using The World Bank's [Global Solar Atlas](https://globalsolaratlas.info/global-pv-potential-study) global horizontal irradiance (GHI) layer.

The web map was built using the following libraries and server:

* [jQuery API](https://api.jquery.com/)
* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

The web map is available [here](https://einavg7.github.io/Rosario_Solar_Potential/).
